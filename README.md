# Next.js Client-Side Fetch Issue

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using `fetch` within client-side components in a Next.js application. The issue arises when attempting to make API calls directly within a component that renders on the client-side, without properly handling the server-side context.

## Problem

The `about.js` file attempts to fetch data from an API route (`/api/data`) using `fetch` within the component's rendering logic. This approach will fail on the server-side during the initial rendering, because `fetch` is not available in that environment.

## Solution

The `aboutSolution.js` file provides a solution by using `useEffect` from React to perform the fetch only after the component has mounted on the client-side. This ensures that the `fetch` call happens in a context where it is supported.  Additionally, error handling is included to manage potential network issues.
